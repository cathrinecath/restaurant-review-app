We are still talking about the Chocolate Stone dessert months later. The space they have is also beautiful. Try to get a window seat so you can enjoy the beautiful garden they have. We came in early evening and got to watch as the lights came on in the garden gradually after dark. A truly spectacular experience and I highly recommend it!"
